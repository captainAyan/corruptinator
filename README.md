![Poster](https://github.com/captainayan/corruptinator/blob/main/behold_the_meme.jpg?raw=true)

**Corruptinator** is a simple Python application that allows users to modify image files by overwriting their data with random bytes, making them effectively unrecoverable. This tool is useful for securely deleting non-sensitive files and can be customized for various use cases.

### Dramatized Explanation
*[For those who prefer to skip the theatrics, click here to go to the [Features](#features) section.]*

**[Scene: Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated]** 

*Perry the Platypus bursts through the window, landing dramatically.* 

**Doofenshmirtz**: Ah, Perry the Platypus, what an unexpected surprise! And by unexpected, I mean COMPLETELY EXPECTED! 
 
*He activates a trap to capture Perry.* 
 
**Doofenshmirtz**: You see, while you were busy thwarting my evil plans, I was busy developing the **Corruptinator**! 
 
*Perry struggles in the trap, intrigued.* 
 
**Doofenshmirtz**: With this tool, users can select any image file and—BAM!—overwrite its data with random bytes! It’s the perfect way to make files completely unrecoverable! 
 
*Perry raises an eyebrow, clearly skeptical.* 
 
**Doofenshmirtz**: Oh, I know what you’re thinking! “But what if someone tries to recover it?” Well, my dear nemesis, while it’s highly unlikely, advanced recovery techniques might still work! 
 
*Perry looks amused, shaking his head.* 
 
**Doofenshmirtz**: Just make sure to have backups of your important files before using it! And remember, it’s great for securely deleting non-sensitive files! 
 
*Perry escapes the trap, ready to thwart another one of Doof’s plans.* 

## Features
- Select a file to corrupt via a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Overwrites the file with random binary data.
- Uses the Tkinter library for a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
	```bash
   git clone https://github.com/captainAyan/corruptinator.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
	```bash
   cd corruptinator
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
	```bash
	python corruptinator.py
	```
2. Click the "Browse" button to select a PNG file.
3. Click "Submit" to overwrite the selected file with random data.
> **Warning**: This action is irreversible! Ensure you have backups of any important files before using this tool.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
While this tool makes it highly unlikely that overwritten files can be recovered, advanced data recovery techniques may still be able to retrieve some information under certain conditions. For highly sensitive data, consider using additional secure deletion methods.
